# Compound Interest Calculator

## Description
This Python script implements a compound interest calculator, offering the following functionalities:
Future value and installment calculation: Calculates the total value of a loan based on the initial value, number of installments and interest rate.
Interest rate calculation: Calculates the interest rate required for an initial value to become a final value in a given period.
Time calculation: Calculates the time required for an initial value to become a final value, considering a specific interest rate.

## How to Use
Run the script: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the Python script (for example, python calculator_interest.py).
Choose the operation: The program will display a menu with the available options.
Enter the data: Follow the instructions to enter the necessary values ​​for each calculation.
View the result: The result of the calculation will be displayed on the screen.

## Functionalities
Interactive interface: The program guides the user through the calculation process, requesting the necessary data.
Accurate calculations: The formulas used are the correct ones for calculating compound interest.
Flexibility: Allows you to calculate different aspects of a loan, such as future value, interest rate and time.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into functions that perform specific calculations:
calculate_installment: Calculates the value of each installment of a loan.
calculate_interest_rate: Calculates the interest rate needed to reach a certain future value.
calculate_time: Calculates the time needed to reach a certain future value.

## Dependencies
Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Next Steps
Graphical Interface: Create a graphical interface using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt to make the program more user-friendly.
Save Results: Allow users to save the results of the calculations to a file.
Graphs: Add graphs to visualize the evolution of the investment value over time.
Other Features: Implement other features related to finance, such as amortization calculation, annual effective rate (TEA) and other indicators.
